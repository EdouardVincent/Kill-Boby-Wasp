# Kill-Boby-Wasp
2 players 2d game
Hi everyone !

Today, I publish a 2d 2 players game. A player tries to kill you with a swatter and the other is a bee (Boby Wasp), the bee must evade the traps and the swatter. I published a
single player game where you are Boby Wasp and you just must evade the traps : https://github.com/EdouardVincent/Boby-Wasp. The code of "Boby Wasp" and "Kill Boby Wasp" are in
english. I always make my games with the language that I know better (French) but I think that if someone wants to read my code, he wont understand. From now, I will always 
publish my game in english. It's hard for me, but I must do this to be understans by the others people. I use the last version of python (3.9.5) and the last version of
pygame (2.0.1) to make my games. I use Windows and rpi4.

See you later !
